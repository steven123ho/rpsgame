# Rock-Paper-Scissors Web Game

This version of Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple but funny twist on the original. This is a web-game built from HTML, CSS, and Javascript that shows javascript eventListeners, querySelectors, and DOM munipulation. This is my progress from 2 months of learning Web Development.
